\section{Introduction}

Analytical database engines store and process queries on large volumes of data.
Typically, in modern systems, this data is stored in memory. %TODO CITE
These systems scan and filter their data to execute queries.
Multidimensional range queries are a type of query defined by 
intervals in all or some of the columns and are interested in all data items
that are within all the given intervals. Multidimensional range queries that don't specify
an interval for at least one column are called partial range queries, while queries that specify
an interval for all dimensions are called complete range queries.
Multidimensional range queries are a common task for many applications.
For instance, they are used to query sensor data across a section of time and space, as well as in business
intelligence, scientific data and data science \cite{ModernMDRQ}.

With the explosion of analytical data comes the need to answer multidimensional range queries
quickly on large datasets. Multiple approaches have been taken to perform better than
fully scanning the dataset, which is quite wasteful if selectivity
of the query is low. If queries are very selective in one column, then sorting the data
according to that column and building a B-Tree can be a good approach. % TODO CITE
Another approach is to use a multidimensional index, which uses data from multiple dimensions
in its structure. Space filling curves, tree-based structures, and bucketing are three popular approaches
to build multidimensional indexes. Space filling curves, such as the Z-order or the Hilbert curve,
can be used to define an order on $n$-dimensional space, which can then be indexed using 
single-dimensional methods. % TODO cite Hilbert and Z-order
A complication of this approach is that points that are close in
n-dimensional space are not necessarily close together on the curve. % TODO Cite this
Tree-based structures can be though of as the multidimensional extension of B-Trees.
There are a variety methods that take this approach, such as R-Trees, kd-trees. % TODO Cite
Bucketing coarsely partitions the data space into buckets, which are then scanned and filtered
% TODO cite VA-file, grid file, locality sensitive hashing

The recent work by Kraska et al. on learned indices
has cast the problem of single dimensional indexing in a new light \cite{Learned_Index}.
Their key insight is that given the empirical cumulative distribution function
of the dataset, in most cases, a very compact index can be constructed. 
They showed such an index can take orders of magnitude less memory
than a classic B-tree.
This pioneering work has inspired more research into leveraging machine learning 
to efficiently index data, including a very recent work, Flood, for the multidimensional 
case. \cite{ALEX,FITing-Tree,PGM,Flood}. % TODO Cite PGM-Index, Flood
